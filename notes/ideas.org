Catalog of ideas to be scrubbed and planned.

** Problem being solved
   Create a platform that
   - provides a stable, observable test environment
   - helps collaborate between devops, product and quality assurance
   - is community driven: publish and consume envs, resources, fixtures and test data
** User provided, langauge agnostic fixture creation and execution
** Resource vs fixture, A resource
   1. has its own state and scope.
   2. may be held by one or more environments.
   3. can be a terraform or custom implementation.
   4. can be monitored, instrumented and inspected.
   5. can be shared, locked or leased by one or more actors.
   6. A fixture may return a resource spec
      A resource spec has
      - a unique resource id
      - required configurations
      - optional configurations
   7. can be configured and reconfigured.
   8. can be mutated if it is a target
   9. cannot be mutated if it is part of an env.
   10. env is composed of one or many resources.
** Debezium to consume db logs
   - avoid database polling and create an event driven system
